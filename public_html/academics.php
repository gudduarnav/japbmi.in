                                        complicated and diverse, primarily because they incorporate electronic system
                                        for sensing, signal-conditioning, manipulating, storing and displaying the 
                                        information. Medical diagnostic today more and more relies on detailed accurate
                                        measurements of a vast numbers of physiologic parameters for diagnosing illnesses 
                                        and prescribe complicated procedures for treating these. While medical instruments 
                                        acquire and process information and data for monitoring patients and diagnosing 
                                        illnesses medical devices used electrical, mechanical, chemical or radiation energy 
                                        for achieving a desired therapeutic purpose, maintaining physiologic functions or 
                                        assisting a patient's healing process.

                                        new devices and procedures that solve medical and health-related problems by combining
                                        their recent advances knowledge in Engineering, Biology, and medicine to improve human 
                                        health through cross disciplinary activities that integrate the engineering principles 
                                        and design and concepts to medicine and biology for healthcare purposes 
                                        (e.g. diagnostic or therapeutic). This field seeks to close the gap between engineering 
                                        and medicine: biological sciences to advance healthcare treatment, including diagnosis,
                                        monitoring and therapy. Bioengineering field is of service to people work with living
